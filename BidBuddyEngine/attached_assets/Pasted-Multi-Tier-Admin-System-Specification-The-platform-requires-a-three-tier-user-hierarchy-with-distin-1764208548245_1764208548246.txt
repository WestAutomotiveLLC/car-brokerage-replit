Multi-Tier Admin System Specification
The platform requires a three-tier user hierarchy with distinct authentication flows and permission levels. Customer registration follows standard email/password authentication allowing users to place vehicle bids by providing lot numbers and maximum bid amounts, then paying the calculated $215 service fee plus 10% deposit via Stripe integration.

Employee access is gated by a universal company code provided during hiring. Employees register with username/password credentials after entering the company code, gaining immediate system access without additional approval. The employee dashboard provides comprehensive bid management capabilities including: approving/rejecting customer bids, updating bid statuses throughout the auction lifecycle (pending → winning → outbid → won/lost), and contacting users via integrated messaging. All employee actions are permanently tracked in the system audit trail, recording which employee performed each bid status change, though this information is only visible to the super admin.

Super admin privileges encompass all employee capabilities plus exclusive employee management functions. The super admin interface displays a complete employee directory with active status indicators and provides account deletion capabilities. When deleting employee accounts, the system preserves all historical bid approval records while preventing the deleted employee from future system access. Super admin authentication requires two-factor authentication via Supabase for enhanced security. All admin sessions feature automatic logout after periods of inactivity, and employees can self-service password resets without super admin intervention. The system maintains complete separation where customers cannot view employee information, employees cannot see other staff members, and only the super admin has full visibility across all user tiers and activity histories.

This creates a secure, auditable workflow where customer bidding, employee management, and administrative oversight operate within clearly defined permission boundaries while maintaining comprehensive activity tracking for business operations.
